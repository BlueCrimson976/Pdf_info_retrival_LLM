Localized excitations were induced by suddenly modifying the trapping potential using the optical\ndipole force of a focused laser beam. The resulting propagation of sound was observed using a\nnovel technique, rapid sequencing of nondestructive phase-contrast images. The speed of sound\nwas determined as a function of density and found to be consistent with Bogoliubov theory. This method may generally be used to observe high-lying modes and perhaps second sound. [S0031-9007(97)03665-X]\nPACS numbers: 03.75.Fi, 05.30.Jp, 32.80.Pj, 43.35.+d\nThe study of quantum liquids has revealed a wealth of\nphysics such as super\ufb02uidity, second sound, and quantized\nvortices. A microscopic picture of these macroscopic\nquantum phenomena was developed based on elementary\nexcitations and quantum hydrodynamics [1,2]. For a long\ntime such studies were limited to 4He and 3He. The\nrealization of Bose-Einstein condensation in atomic vapors\n[3\u20135], however, has provided a new class of macroscopic\nquantum \ufb02uids which are dilute gases. An important\nissue, which applies both to quantum liquids and quantum\ngases, is the characterization of the system by its collective\nexcitations. Several experimental [6,7] and theoretical\n[8,9] papers have studied oscillations in Bose-Einstein\ncondensed gases of trapped atoms. So far, the resonance\nfrequencies and the damping of only the few lowest\nmodes have been investigated. Due to the small size of\nthe trapped clouds, the discrete nature of the spectrum\nis dominant, in contrast to the continuous spectrum of\nquantum liquids, which is phononlike at low frequencies. The correspondence between the excitation spectrum of\na quantum liquid [2], which consists of zeroth, \ufb01rst, and\nsecond sound, and the collective modes of a trapped Bose-\nEinstein condensate have not yet been delineated. In this Letter we study zeroth sound in Bose-Einstein\ncondensed samples. After exciting density perturbations\nmuch smaller than the size of the condensate, we directly\nobserved the propagation of sound waves, analogous\nto studies in super\ufb02uids, and determined the speed of\nsound. In this study, we demonstrated a method for\nlocally exciting a condensate using a focused off-resonant\nlaser beam, and a new technique of observing dynamical\nprocesses using rapid sequencing of nondestructive phase-\ncontrast images.

Therefore, previous experiments on\ncollective excitations [6,7] did not yield direct information\non the speed of sound. The experimental setup for creating Bose-Einstein con-\ndensates was similar to our previous work [7,13,14]. Brie\ufb02y, sodium atoms were optically cooled and trapped,\nand transferred into a magnetic trap where they were\nfurther cooled by rf-induced evaporation [15]. Conden-\nsates typically containing 5 3 106 sodium atoms in the\nF \u00ad 1, mF \u00ad 21 ground state were produced every 30 s. In most cases we studied condensates with no discernible\nthermal component by extending the evaporative cool-\ning well below the transition temperature. The conden-\nsate was con\ufb01ned in a cloverleaf magnetic trap, with the\ntrapping potential determined by the axial curvature of\nthe magnetic \ufb01eld of up to B00 \u00ad 125 G cm22 , the radial\ngradient B0 \u00ad 120 G cm21, and the bias \ufb01eld as low as\nB0 \u00ad 1.5 G. The atom clouds were cigar-shaped, with\nthe long axis horizontal. The condensate was directly observed by nondestructive\nphase-contrast imaging [16].

The phase modulation in the probe beam caused\nby the condensate was transformed into an intensity modu-\nlation at the camera by retarding the transmitted probe\nbeam by a quarter-wave. This was done using a glass plate\nwith a small raised spot (500 mm diameter) at its center,\nplaced in the Fourier plane of the imaging system, where\nthe transmitted probe beam is focused. Since the probe\nlight was detuned far off-resonance (1.7 GHz to the red),\nabsorption was very small [17], and the small-angle for-\nward scattering imparted negligible recoil energies to the\ncondensed atoms. Thus our imaging was nondestructive,\nallowing multiple images of the same condensate. Rapid\nimages were taken by dividing a CCD camera chip into\neleven strips, and shifting the accumulated charge after\neach exposure from the illuminated region of the chip into\na covered \u201cstorage\u201d region. After eleven exposures taken\nwith a repetition rate of up to 1 kHz, the full chip was read\nout slowly with low noise. Localized density pertubations were generated by\nusing the repulsive optical dipole force of a focused\nblue-detuned far-off-resonant laser beam. Heating from\nspontaneous emission was negligible due to the far de-\ntuning of the argon ion laser line (514 nm) relative to the\nsodium resonance (589 nm). This laser beam was focused\ninto the center of the trap, and could be switched on and\noff in less than a millisecond. The 1ye2 half-widths\nwere about 12 mm and 100 mm, which created a light\nshift of ,70 nK per 1 mW of laser power. Localized\nincreases in density (positive perturbations) were created\nby suddenly switching on the argon ion laser beam after\nthe condensate had formed [see Fig. 1(a)].

Figures 2 and 3 show the propagation of density pertur-\nbations observed by sequential phase-contrast imaging of\na single condensate. The position of the density maxima\nvaried linearly with time, and the speed of propagation\nwas easily extracted. By changing the power of the argon\nion laser, the relative amplitude of the density perturbation\nwas varied between 20 and 100%. Within the accuracy of\nthe measurement, the speed of sound was independent of\namplitudes and was the same for positive and negative\nperturbations.

The scattering\nlength a was recently determined spectroscopically to be\n2.75 nm [18]. Condensates up to 450 mm in length were\nobserved (Fig. 2). Alternatively, the density was obtained\nfrom the observed phase shift of the probe light and the\ndirectly observed size of the condensate.

However, the local speed of sound varies\nover the radial cross section of the cloud. One can\nobtain a one-dimensional wave equation by eliminating\nthe radial degrees of freedom.

The\nsmall discrepancy at higher densities is larger than our\nstatistical error and might indicate that the assumptions\nof adiabaticity of the radial motion and the neglect of\ndamping and dispersion are not strictly valid. Indeed, in addition to propagation at a constant speed,\nwe observed spreading of the pulse (Fig. 3). The pulses\ndispersed typically after traveling half their way to the\nends of the condensate, preventing the observation of\nFIG. 4. Speed of sound versus condensate peak density.

The error\nbars show only the statistical error. a re\ufb02ection of the pulse or of a decrease in the speed\nof propagation in the lower-density outer regions of the\ncondensate. In the language of collective excitations, a localized per-\nturbation is a coherent superposition of many modes [1]. In a homogenous Bose-Einstein condensate, the dispersion\nrelation is linear (phononlike) up to wave vectors compa-\nrable to the inverse of the healing length j \u00ad s8pand21y2,\nwhich is approximately 0.2 mm at the peak density of the\ncondensate. Since the extent of the initial perturbation was\nlarger than the healing length, we should have excited pre-\ndominantly phononlike quasiparticles. The dispersion of\nthe wave packet can be due either to damping or to de-\nphasing of the modes, and we expect the inhomogeneous\ndensity distribution of the condensate to play an essential\nrole. After a long time one expects the mode with the\nsmallest damping to dominate. Indeed, in the case of a\nnegative density perturbation, after the propagating pulses\ndied out during the \ufb01rst 25 ms, we observed the lowest col-\nlective excitation (the 30 Hz quadrupolelike mode) with a\ndamping time of 300 6 120 ms, consistent with our earlier\nmeasurement [7]. We also studied sound propagation at various tempera-\ntures. By varying the \ufb01nal frequency of the rf sweep\nduring evaporative cooling, we prepared samples with\ncondensate fractions varying from 10% to larger than 60%\n[19]. The speed of sound decreased with temperature\nin accordance with Eq. (2) where nsrd accounts for the\nsmaller condensate density. Thus, within the accuracy\nof measurement we observed no effect of the normal\ncomponent on the speed of zeroth sound. The dispersion\nof the pulses was similar over the whole temperature range\nstudied. Further experimental work is necessary to study\n\ufb01nite temperature effects in detail. Above the phase transition we saw no clear evidence\nof sound wave propagation in the normal cloud. At\nan estimated density of 1014 cm23 and for an elastic\nscattering cross section of 1.9 3 10212 cm2 [18], the\nmean free path between collisions is l \u00f8 35 mm. Thus\nthe argon ion laser-induced density modulations of spatial\nextent l , l. In contrast to the \u201chydrodynamic\u201d regime\n555\n", "12": "VOLUME 79, NUMBER 4\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S\n28 JULY 1997\n(l \u00bf l), such a density pertubation expands ballistically\nand the amplitude decreases rapidly, which is consistent\nwith our observation. Additional information on the pulse propagation can be\nobtained by using the time-of-\ufb02ight technique. After cre-\nating two Bose-Einstein condensates by evaporative cool-\ning in a double-well potential (see [14] for details), we\nswitched off the argon ion laser beam a variable time (up\nto 40 ms) before switching off the magnetic trap, and let\nthe cloud expand ballistically. Absorption images taken\nafter 40 ms expansion showed \u201cinterference\u201d-like struc-\ntures with coarse (100 mm) and \ufb01ne (15 mm) striations\n[20]. The latter were similar to those observed in the in-\nterference of two Bose-Einstein condensates [14], whereas\nthe coarse structures are probably related to collective ex-\ncitations caused by propagating wave packets. Focused laser beams can excite collective modes which\ncannot be excited by simply varying the magnetic trapping\npotential. Short-wavelength excitations can be studied\nby using tightly focused beams. To excite a speci\ufb01c\nhigh-frequency mode, one could periodically modify the\nlaser power, or even focus several laser beams near the\nantinodes of the mode. Another intriguing prospect is the excitation of sec-\nond sound. Second sound is a collective excitation for\nwhich the density of the condensate and the normal com-\nponent oscillate out of phase; this corresponds to a tem-\nperature wave. By focusing near-resonant light into the\ncondensate, one could locally heat the sample by sponta-\nneous scattering and excite such a wave. In our quasi-\none-dimensional geometry, the signature of second sound\ncould be a density minimum in the condensate accom-\npanied by a density maximum in the surrounding normal\ncloud, both propagating together along the axial direction. When we replaced the argon ion laser beam by a beam\nof near-resonant light, we locally \u201cevaporated\u201d the con-\ndensate, but could not discern a localized normal fraction. This was probably due to the ballistic spreading discussed\nabove\u2014the excitation is rapidly damped. Furthermore,\nthe near-resonant light also caused trap loss due to optical\npumping to nontrapped states. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new method to\nexcite collective excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensed\ncloud and have determined the speed of sound as a\nfunction of condensate density. This method allows for\ncomparison with sound propagation in He II and is\npromising for the study of higher-lying excitations and\nperhaps for studying second sound. Furthermore, the\nmethod of rapid sequencing of phase-contrast images was\nused to determine the speed of sound and the frequency\nand damping of collective modes. This technique allows\nfor single shot measurements of dynamical processes\nand has two main advantages over previous techniques. The measuring time is greatly reduced, and studies of\ndynamical properties are possible that might be otherwise\nobscured by experimental or statistical \ufb02uctuations. We thank C.
